- Add mini chests which can hold 1 stack, can be crafted with 4 paper around a chest, note these do not have iron, gold, ect variants
- New storage mutator mode: "swap theme" which lets you swap between themes for the same block tier,
    this lets you get pumpkin and Christmas chests from wood chests and swap between the various mini chest styles.
- Fixed some issues with Piglin guarding tag and also revert to the old tag format.
- Fixed the map color of Christmas chest variants
- Remove some unnecessary data from models as well as some minor relocation for barrel and old chest base models.
- Major resource / data pack renames, generally moving from Christmas chest -> present
- Fixed rotation of horizontal chests splitting the chest and only rotating one half.
- Fixed weirdness with comparators on double chests, specifically when formed / broken.
- Each half of a double chest now return the same inventory and transfer api storage object.
- Recipes now use even more common tags, specifically iron, gold, diamond, and netherite, and obsidian on forge

Now for the corny bit, big thanks to the AOF maintainers and community (mainly official eu server) for being so kind and genuinely making me happy.
